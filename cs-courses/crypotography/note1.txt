Introduction

Cryptography: 
Encrypting and decreypting data
Transform data by cipher or cryptosystem

Covers: algorithms, protocols, services, applications

Secret-key model

plaintext input -> secret key shared by sender and recipient, encryption -> transmitted ciphertext -> decryption -> plaintext output

SGG Secret-Key Cryptography

Caesar Cipher: substitution cipher  replace each letter by kth letter on
cat+3 = FDW

cipher - algorithm
C = E(M), M = D(C)

crypptanalysis (code breaking) - how to decipher the ciphertext w/o knowing the key
