Secret-key cryptography

conventionl/private-key/single-key/symmetric

eg. DES  3DES   AES

AES replacement of DES

Limitation of secret-key cryptography: 

exchange secret key securely
courier
key distribution center:  session keys
public-key crypotography


----------------------------
Public-key cryptography

Solve problem of securely exchanging secret keys ahead of time
Asymmetric:  Use two inversely related keys 
        public key   freely distributed
        private key  kept secret by its owner

eg RSA Diffie-Hellman

----------------------------

Advantage of public key crypto

   no key exchange ahead of time
   slow due to algorithms 100-1000x slower compared with secret-key crypto

----------------------------
Hybrid Cryptosystems
   Use secret-key to encrypt data
   Use public-key to exchange secret key

----------------------------
Access control
   Done once before user can use the system
   Authentication: password, biometrics, smart cards
   
   Virtual Circuit 
      circuit gets established
-----------------------------
   Message authentication 
   send both plaintext and cipher text to check the secret key
-----------------------------
   Digital Signatures

Want to electronically sign a document


-------------------------------
Crypotographic hashing

bit manipulation , so fast
Hash function is public, used in a digital signature, H(M) as a representation of "M"

M, encrypt H(M)

weakness: find M' with same hash value of M
Hash function : nearly 0 collisions
eg MD5

-------------------------------
Cryptanalysis

C=Ek (M) 
BG wants the message or secret key

Types of attacks:   

   ciphertext only: can identify plaintext M when he sees it

   known plaintext: knows one or more M, C pairs

   chosen plaintext:
