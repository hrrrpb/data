Monoalphabetic Cipher [B]

shuffle the letters arbitrarily

Cipher keys:
26! = 4 x 10^26

language characteristics : frequency analysis 

which letter most commonly used in english: E

e t a o s n ...

standard table of single letter frequencies

check single letter first, then diagram..


Mod/Matrices

a mod b = c
a = c mod b

eg 
7 mod 3  + 5 mod 3 mod 3 = 0
7 + 5 mod 3 = 0

same rule applies to  - and *, and **



-1 mod 3 = 2
-> 3 - 1 mod 3 = 2

identity matrix
matrix inversion


Hill Cipher [modified MS]

a pre-modern block cipher

groups of letter are mapped to other groups of letters

plaintext, p0, p1, p2, .....
each pi : block of n consecutive letters
   - as a column vector

Let K be n x n invertible matrix mod 26
ci = K pi (mod 26)
decryption:  pi = K-1 ci (mod 26)


The matrix is the Key

- get away from frequency analysis
- get away from linear
