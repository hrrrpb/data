Initial Value : can use timestamp

ECB vs CBC

IV: inital value or vector

CBC, chaining makes the switch and replacement not do-able

CBC: encryption can not be done in parallel, decryption can be done in parallel
     random access for decryption

error tolerance of CBC: 

  encryption: 1 bit changed, affected locally

  bulk data encryption
  authentication

OFB : output feed back
one-time pad with pseudorandom numbers

fault tolerance: only locally, good for noisy channel

steam cipher
weakness: intercept and get the random code, and create fake message

--------------------------------------
Combining block ciphers

why? double des or triple des
method is not robust enough, repeat , get more secure
differnt keys

C= EK2[EK1[P]]

112 bits or 168 bits

why not double-des

meet-in-the-middle attack

triple DES: could be 2 or 3 keys
E-D-E sequence
advantage:  for compatiblity with old DES   backwards compatibility
standardized in ANSI X9.17 

USED IN PGP, S/MIME

IS SLOW


----------------------------------
Public-key cryptography

no need to exchange key in advance
very slow

public key
secret key


- easy to generate keys
- computationally easy to en/decrypt the message
- computationally infeasible to find decryption key knowing only algorithms and encryption key
- one way function
- digital signatures


one-way function:
y = f(x)
known x, get y easily

x = f-1(y)
known y, cannot get x
