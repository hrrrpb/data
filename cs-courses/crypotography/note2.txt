Published / restricted algorithms

Restricted:  keep algorithm secret

Published:  make algorithm public

Crypotosystem properties:
No loss of information
Speed
Security
   unconditional security: cipher cannot be broken
   computational security: limited computing resources, cipher cannot be broken

Moore's Law : 18 months, double speed

Monoalphabetic Cipher
-Plain text letter maps to a different random ciphertext letter

# keys = 26!   huge number, not practically do-able

Services, algorithms, assumption
-Services: what do we want as users
      And what kind of algorithms will work

 eg ordering over amazon
    message authentication 
    confidentiality
