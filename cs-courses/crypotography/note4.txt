Attacks classification 
  - Passive threats:  release of message contects, traffice analysis
  - Active threats : masquerade ,replay, modification of message contents, DOS


Protocols : 
  - Cryptographic protocols

Trusted third parties
  - Aka arbitrators

Steps for providing security services

Security facilities in the TCP/IP protocol stack

Steganography
  - hides existence of message
  

One-time pad[MS]
  - Modified from Mark Stamp
  - A provably secure cipher
  - impractical for most applications. 
  - P, C, K are all equally long bit strings
    C = P XOR K, how to recover P?  C XOR K = P


Substitution/Transposition Ciphers
  - Substitution: where letter replaced by other letters
  - Transposition (aka permutation) ciphers
      - rearranging the letter order
  - Modern secret key crypto uses both


Rail Fence Cipher
  - write message letters out diagonally over a number of rows
  - then read off cipher row by row

Row Transposition Ciphers
  - write letters out in rows, reorder the columns according to some key, read off the columns

Product Ciphers
  - use several ciphers in succession to make more complex

Math Preliminaries: 
  - Ceiling  int >= x
  - Floor    int <=x
  - sum, product 
  - factorial
  - exponential 
  - log
