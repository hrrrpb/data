Python attributes:
 scripting language - shorter programs
 Interpretive - portability, less efficient
 Simple, clear - syntax
 Many application areas - lots of packages
 Quicker development
 Objecct-oriented

Basic data types  (variable is pointer)

Numbers - integers, floating point, complex, boolean
  e.g. a = 10 , a refereces integer object 10
	spaces not critical, no semi colon after statement
        objects in python not immutable
        b = 10, pointing to the same integer object 10
        a = 5, system creates a new integer object of 5, and makes a pointing to        the new object
        unused objects recycled by garbage collection, tagged for garbage 
        collection.
Integer - in C, - 2 billion to 2 billion, 2 power 32 
          in python, no limit, infinite length
          +/- digits
          Hex OxFA
	  Octal Oo72
          Binary Ob0011
          +, -, *, /(keep fraction part), //(chop off fraction), %, 
          **(exponentiation)
Floats - 64 bit   10.5e+04
          /, //(see above)
Boolean - True, False
